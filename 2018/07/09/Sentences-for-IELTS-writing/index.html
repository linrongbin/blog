<li>This essay will elaborate on the strengths of international cooperation in environmental protection.</li>

<li>Although technological advances would create a number of problems, their overall effect may be positive.</li>
<li>Globalization poses both opportunities and problems for every industry on a global international worldwide scale.</li>
<li>This essay will analyse the different functions that genetics and the environment play in the criminal behaviour of individuals.</li>
<li>There cannot be enough evidence to conclude the the point that genetics play the most important role in the outcome or behaviour of an individual.</li>
<li>It seams obvious to reach the conclusion that an individual’s criminal behaviour can be the result of both their genetic background and the environment in which they were raised.</li>
<li>Today’s employment environment has become increasingly skill- and experience-based.</li>
<li>Air is the fastest mode of transportation, followed by rail and automobiles.</li>
<li>Domestic violence is a huge problem in much of the world.</li>
<li>Industrial air pollution, especially that of the developing nations, is extremely harmful not only to the surrouding environment, but also to the inhabitants of that country as well.</li>
<li>Media is both a source of information and a source of a entertainment.</li>
<li>It is difficult to estimat or measure the importance of media in today’s society.</li>
<li>Modern advertising is an integral segment of urban industrial civilization, mirroring contemporary life in its best and worst aspects.</li>
<li>The architect of an apartment building can easily be at cross-purposes with the owners of the building and with the future tenants regarding the look of a building.</li>
<li>An ageing population and a declining birth rate constitute a serious problem for the domestic employment market.</li>
<li>Tertiary education is a central part of lifelong learning nowadays and a cornerstone of today’s knowledage society.</li>
<li>Most of medical progresses, including improved organ transplant techniques, cancer therapy, better understanding and control of heart diseases, are, in some measure, due to animal experiments.</li>
<li>The financial weight of tertiary education on a government’s budget is often heavy.</li>
<li>Overcrowding has become one of the most serious social problems as a direct result of housing shortages.</li>
<li>One mission of teachers is to help students to develop new perspectives and strive for achivable social and academic goals.</li>
<li>Government’s control over the content of art, entertainment, news or information is fundamentally at odds with the principles of freedom of speech.</li>
<li>Urban infrastructure development is unlikely to keep pace with urban population growth.</li>
<li>Water is critical for long-term economic development, human health and environmental sustainability.</li>
<li>Finding a solution to environmental problems is one of the greatest challenges that face the scientists today.</li>
<li>Landfills can pose health risks to humans and other animals, resulting in the spread of disease.</li>
<li>To deal with crop pests, farmers can consider replacing deadly chemicals with natural enemies.</li>
<li>Measures to improve the health care system include building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population.</li>
<li>A country’s dysfunctinal healthcare system reflects its biggest problems - the ever-increasing divide between rich and the poor, the city and the countryside, the low transparency and inefficiency of government departments.</li>
<li>Beyond providing functional characteristics, designers consider visual appeals, in an effort to improve the marketablity of manufactured products.</li>
<li>Single-parent families cannot guarantee a normal development of a child.</li>
<li>Human longevity will contribute to the forward progression of mankind.</li>
<li>Rapid population growth will put a strain on economies around the world.</li>

<li>Technological advances can lead to more efficient uses of natural resources and sustain economic growth.</li>
<li>By taxes and tolls, the government can ensure a balance between private and public transport.</li>
<li>Exposure to violence shown in the media has desensitised audiences to the harmful consequences of violence.</li>
<li>Children and adolescents from broken homes, in general, have poorer social skills, lower self-esteem, and higher levels of depression.</li>
<li>Knowledge of foreign languages often has been considered an important indicator of higher education.</li>
<li>Trends toward the globalization of industry are believed to have effects on cultural diversity around the world.</li>
<li>Longer lifespan is believed to pose challenges for retirement provision and workforce.</li>
<li>Lack of funding cannot be taken as an excuse for making no efforts to address environmental problems.</li>
<li>Many people owe their success not to formal schooling but to self-education, a drive for achievement and other factors.</li>
<li>Given the limited financial capacities of rural authorities and the large number of rural poor, a significant increase in government spending on healthcare is required.</li>
<li>Advertising makes people buy unaffordable products just to show off.</li>
<li>Many people consider urban sprawl to be the fastest growing threat to their local environment and quality of life.</li>
<li>Excessive use of natural resources can place human life and animals at risk.</li>
<li>Many people regard cruelty to animals as a major moral issue.</li>
<li>Computer-based after-school programmes / extra-curriculum activities allow children to achive gains in reading, mathematics and computer knowledage.</li>
<li>The cost of social security and medical care is doomed to multiply if the trend towards lifespan extension continues.</li>
<li>Animals are widely used in experiments because their behaviour resembles considerably colsely that of humans.</li>
<li>Just as almost every human activity has costs as well as benefits, there are some drawbacks in expanding the global tourism industry.</li>
<li>Just as mechinery is integral to industrialization, the rapid transfer of information is central to the development of a service economy.</li>
<li>The conservation of indigenous cultures may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species is to life.</li>
<li>Since the automobile has made transportation to and from urban centres easy and inexpensive, urban living has lost the advantage of convenience.</li>
<li>As forest and other habitats are converted to residential, commercial or agricultural use, wild plants and animals vanish.</li>
<li>Since computers and the Internet became the mainstream in the early 1990s, its importance and centrality in communication has become unassilable/unalterable.</li>
<li>The role of architecture is unique because it combines art form with functional use.</li>
<li>Trees are very important because they can reduce pollutants and improve air quality.</li>
<li>English will cease to be a foreign language for many of the world’s citizens as it has been repositioned as a basic skill, and learned as a basic requirement for employability, alongside other 21th century skills, such as computer skills and numeracy.</li>
<li>The government should seek to meet social objectives while modernising the economy.</li>
<li>Although there is some upper limit to the intellectual ability of children of various ages, their potential will not be known with certainty.</li>
<li>While pollution on the world scale is still worsening, there is a clear trend toward decrease in the developed countries.</li>
<li>As economy and technolgy advance, more money and better techniques have become available for minimising pollution.</li>
<li>Regardless of / Irrespective of age or gender, people should have the equal access to job opportunities, provided that they are competent enough.</li>
<li>A prevailing notion is that oral messages are more important than non-verbal messages in communication.</li>
<li>Another fact to highlight the importance of teamwork is that on some complex assessments, students’ individual efforts are far from enough.</li>
<li>The net result of excessive energy use is that environmental problems are exacerbated, such as acid rain, the greenhouse effect, soil erosion and the general degradation of the quality of air, water and land.</li>
<li>The strongest argument against fashion is that it looks pretty and catches your eye but it is impractical indeed.</li>
<li>It is why stunning-looking buildings are far less marketable than those buildings with functional utility.</li>
<li>Another benefit of studying aboard is that we can meet the locals and sample the local culture.</li>
<li>We have recognised the fact that the emerging technologies are blurring the boundary between work and life.</li>
<li>It is universally belived that building conversation is of great importance, not only for the building’s inherent historical and aesthetic value but also as a reference for further architectural development.</li>
<li>It is likely that population pressure will lead to greater numbers of people living in the suburbs.</li>
<li>It is generally believed that culture can be deemed as the way of life for a society, including manners, dresses, languages, religions, rituals,</li>
<li>norms of behaviour and systems of belief.</li>
