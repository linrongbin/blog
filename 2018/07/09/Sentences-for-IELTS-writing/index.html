It is my considered opinion that the role of art is indispensable, although its impact on our society is not always manifest. 1. It is my view that many factors should be taken into consideration when we evaluate the benefits of the international tourism industry. 1. The pros and cons importing fruits and vegetables from overseas will be discussed below. 1. Two points are critical in understanding this argument. 1. Both sides/arguments are partly right. 1.

Although technological advances would create a number of problems, their overall effect may be positive. 1. Globalization poses both opportunities and problems for every industry on a global international worldwide scale. 1. This essay will analyse the different functions that genetics and the environment play in the criminal behaviour of individuals. 1. There cannot be enough evidence to conclude the the point that genetics play the most important role in the outcome or behaviour of an individual. 1. It seams obvious to reach the conclusion that an individual’s criminal behaviour can be the result of both their genetic background and the environment in which they were raised. 1. Today’s employment environment has become increasingly skill- and experience-based. 1. Air is the fastest mode of transportation, followed by rail and automobiles. 1. Domestic violence is a huge problem in much of the world. 1. Industrial air pollution, especially that of the developing nations, is extremely harmful not only to the surrouding environment, but also to the inhabitants of that country as well. 1. Media is both a source of information and a source of a entertainment. 1. It is difficult to estimat or measure the importance of media in today’s society. 1. Modern advertising is an integral segment of urban industrial civilization, mirroring contemporary life in its best and worst aspects. 1. The architect of an apartment building can easily be at cross-purposes with the owners of the building and with the future tenants regarding the look of a building. 1. An ageing population and a declining birth rate constitute a serious problem for the domestic employment market. 1. Tertiary education is a central part of lifelong learning nowadays and a cornerstone of today’s knowledage society. 1. Most of medical progresses, including improved organ transplant techniques, cancer therapy, better understanding and control of heart diseases, are, in some measure, due to animal experiments. 1. The financial weight of tertiary education on a government’s budget is often heavy. 1. Overcrowding has become one of the most serious social problems as a direct result of housing shortages. 1. One mission of teachers is to help students to develop new perspectives and strive for achivable social and academic goals. 1. Government’s control over the content of art, entertainment, news or information is fundamentally at odds with the principles of freedom of speech. 1. Urban infrastructure development is unlikely to keep pace with urban population growth. 1. Water is critical for long-term economic development, human health and environmental sustainability. 1. Finding a solution to environmental problems is one of the greatest challenges that face the scientists today. 1. Landfills can pose health risks to humans and other animals, resulting in the spread of disease. 1. To deal with crop pests, farmers can consider replacing deadly chemicals with natural enemies. 1. Measures to improve the health care system include building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population. 1. A country’s dysfunctinal healthcare system reflects its biggest problems - the ever-increasing divide between rich and the poor, the city and the countryside, the low transparency and inefficiency of government departments. 1. Beyond providing functional characteristics, designers consider visual appeals, in an effort to improve the marketablity of manufactured products. 1. Single-parent families cannot guarantee a normal development of a child. 1. Human longevity will contribute to the forward progression of mankind. 1. Rapid population growth will put a strain on economies around the world. 1. Many children will learning difficulties can easily lose their enthusiasm for classroom work, because of feeling hopeless among their high-achieving classmates. 1. Many people now prefer to spend time in front of the computer rather than with their family. 1. Lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart diseases, have placed an unprecedented strain on health-care systems. 1. Technological advances can lead to more efficient uses of natural resources and sustain economic growth. 1. By taxes and tolls, the government can ensure a balance between private and public transport. 1. Exposure to violence shown in the media has desensitised audiences to the harmful consequences of violence. 1. Children and adolescents from broken homes, in general, have poorer social skills, lower self-esteem, and higher levels of depression. 1. Knowledge of foreign languages often has been considered an important indicator of higher education. 1. Trends toward the globalization of industry are believed to have effects on cultural diversity around the world. 1. Longer lifespan is believed to pose challenges for retirement provision and workforce. 1. Lack of funding cannot be taken as an excuse for making no efforts to address environmental problems. 1. Many people owe their success not to formal schooling but to self-education, a drive for achievement and other factors. 1. Given the limited financial capacities of rural authorities and the large number of rural poor, a significant increase in government spending on healthcare is required. 1. Advertising makes people buy unaffordable products just to show off. 1. Many people consider urban sprawl to be the fastest growing threat to their local environment and quality of life. 1. Excessive use of natural resources can place human life and animals at risk. 1. Many people regard cruelty to animals as a major moral issue. 1. Computer-based after-school programmes / extra-curriculum activities allow children to achive gains in reading, mathematics and computer knowledage. 1. The cost of social security and medical care is doomed to multiply if the trend towards lifespan extension continues. 1. Animals are widely used in experiments because their behaviour resembles considerably colsely that of humans. 1. Just as almost every human activity has costs as well as benefits, there are some drawbacks in expanding the global tourism industry. 1. Just as mechinery is integral to industrialization, the rapid transfer of information is central to the development of a service economy. 1. The conservation of indigenous cultures may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species is to life. 1. Since the automobile has made transportation to and from urban centres easy and inexpensive, urban living has lost the advantage of convenience. 1. As forest and other habitats are converted to residential, commercial or agricultural use, wild plants and animals vanish. 1. Since computers and the Internet became the mainstream in the early 1990s, its importance and centrality in communication has become unassilable/unalterable. 1. The role of architecture is unique because it combines art form with functional use. 1. Trees are very important because they can reduce pollutants and improve air quality. 1. English will cease to be a foreign language for many of the world’s citizens as it has been repositioned as a basic skill, and learned as a basic requirement for employability, alongside other 21th century skills, such as computer skills and numeracy. 1. The government should seek to meet social objectives while modernising the economy. 1. Although there is some upper limit to the intellectual ability of children of various ages, their potential will not be known with certainty. 1. While pollution on the world scale is still worsening, there is a clear trend toward decrease in the developed countries. 1. As economy and technolgy advance, more money and better techniques have become available for minimising pollution. 1. Regardless of / Irrespective of age or gender, people should have the equal access to job opportunities, provided that they are competent enough. 1. A prevailing notion is that oral messages are more important than non-verbal messages in communication. 1. Another fact to highlight the importance of teamwork is that on some complex assessments, students’ individual efforts are far from enough. 1. The net result of excessive energy use is that environmental problems are exacerbated, such as acid rain, the greenhouse effect, soil erosion and the general degradation of the quality of air, water and land. 1. The strongest argument against fashion is that it looks pretty and catches your eye but it is impractical indeed. 1. It is why stunning-looking buildings are far less marketable than those buildings with functional utility. 1. Another benefit of studying aboard is that we can meet the locals and sample the local culture. 1. We have recognised the fact that the emerging technologies are blurring the boundary between work and life. 1. It is universally belived that building conversation is of great importance, not only for the building’s inherent historical and aesthetic value but also as a reference for further architectural development. 1. It is likely that population pressure will lead to greater numbers of people living in the suburbs. 1. It is generally believed that culture can be deemed as the way of life for a society, including manners, dresses, languages, religions, rituals, 1. norms of behaviour and systems of belief. 1. It cannot be denied that most of the problems affecting the natural world such as ozone depletion, deforestations, species extinction and the greenhouse effect are by-products of ecominic growth. 1. There is little evidence that technological change have resulted in an overall education in employment. 1. Research has received that young people who are exposed to adversements for alcohol are likely to drink more. 1. Higher exposure to violence increases the chances that those exposed to the media will learn or contemplate using violence. 1. In architecture, functinalism represents a principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building. 1. Many people now hold the view that education is a lifetime activity, and during the course of learning, there will always be new skills and experiences. 1. The fact that skills can be developed through life experiences, such as educcation, training, work, leisure activities and family life, is known to everybody. 1. Fears of crime stem largely from the fact that crime rates are on the rise and violent crimes are well-documented. 1. There is no doubt that in recent years people have become more used to seeing police officers carrying guns. 1. All evidence points to the fact that working and finishing scholling can mix, if working is done in moderation. 1. The emphasis of the government on music and art can be justified/supported by the fact that people have paid attention to / valued entertainment and recreation/relaxation. 1. Considering the fact that women now occupy a substantial number of the decision-making positions in many walks of life, their underrepresentation in the military service is open to debate. 1. One possible explanation for the higher rates of joblessness among young people is that the existing education system fails to deliver employable individuals. 1. Many people have pointed out that advertising is unlikely to be the only or the main factor in the changes in lifestyle over the past decades. 1. It is worth noting / It should be noted that repeated exposure to a brand during the course of an advertising campaign can enhance consumers’ memory of the brand and improve their attitudes toward this brand. 1. It is not a secret that despite the continued boom in the housing market, there are still a large number of families living in cramped conditions. 1. It has been agreed that when immersed in local life, an immigrant can be easily adjust to and succeed in a new country. 1. It is the public’s perception that the government should take reasonable steps to ensure the welfare of all citizens and protect their interests. 1. It is an everyday occurrence that parents instruct their child on each act and accept only one way to do things. 1. It is common to say that every environmental problem has causes, effects and solutions, but hardly has any solution been paid enough attention to. 1. It has been argued that human beings should not use animals for food, as enterainment, and in research. 1. It is my view that the development of cultural awareness and sensitivity can assit in avoiding intercultural confusion and tensioin and promoting mutual understanding and respect. 1. It is expected that young people can adapt to a new country more easily because they have less fixed ideas, beliefs and personalities. 1. It is the public’s perception that many resources such as oil and coal are non-renewable and should not be used wastefully, while renewable resources such as air and water should be used properly and managed carefully. 1. It is obvious that lifestyles in rural areas are distinct from those in urban areas, partly because public services and facilities are limited there. 1. It is always interesting to find that many people want to protect the environment but meanwhile, refuse to make any change in lifestyle or buying habits. 1. There is a growing recognition that animals should not be used or regarded as property by human beings. 1. Considering the fact that learners are allowed to control the time and place for studies, distance learning is very likely to become more popular in the years ahead. 1. There is no guarantee that a generous welfare system can bring economic security to all the people living in poverty. 1. There is a general acceptance that the government should balance its budget. 1. There is little doubt that parents can have a significant role in moderating or modifying the influence of media on children’s knowledge, attitudes and values. 1. The main advantage of studying abroad is that young people are totally immersed in the language, not just in classes, but the rest of the time as well. 1. It is no exaggeration to say that the balance between work, domestic and personaly life is a luxury to many working mothers. 1. I am convinced that there is clear relationship between advertising and eating choices among children. 1. There is no reason to suspect that economic reforms help close the divide between rich and poor. 1. There is much evidence to suggest that some individuals have a greater aptitude for creativity than others. 1. We have been aware that many traditions seem to be going out of fashion. 1. People have come to realise that they can take advantage of computer ownership and Internet access to further education. 1. It is obvious that people differ in many dimensions, including age, ethinicity, social background and gender. 1.
