<li>There cannot be enough evidence to conclude the the point that genetics play the most important role in the outcome or behaviour of an individual.</li>
<li>It seams obvious to reach the conclusion that an individual’s criminal behaviour can be the result of both their genetic background and the environment in which they were raised.</li>
<li>Today’s employment environment has become increasingly skill- and experience-based.</li>
<li>Air is the fastest mode of transportation, followed by rail and automobiles.</li>

<li>Media is both a source of information and a source of a entertainment.</li>
<li>It is difficult to estimat or measure the importance of media in today’s society.</li>
<li>Modern advertising is an integral segment of urban industrial civilization, mirroring contemporary life in its best and worst aspects.</li>
<li>The architect of an apartment building can easily be at cross-purposes with the owners of the building and with the future tenants regarding the look of a building.</li>

<li>Finding a solution to environmental problems is one of the greatest challenges that face the scientists today.</li>
<li>Landfills can pose health risks to humans and other animals, resulting in the spread of disease.</li>
<li>To deal with crop pests, farmers can consider replacing deadly chemicals with natural enemies.</li>
<li>Measures to improve the health care system include building low-cost hospitals in cities and providing healthcare insurance to the whole population.</li>
<li>A country’s dysfunctinal healthcare system reflects its biggest problems - the ever-increasing divide between rich and the poor, the city and the countryside, the low transparency and inefficiency of government departments.</li>

<li>Human longevity will contribute to the forward progression of mankind.</li>

<li>Advertising makes people buy unaffordable products just to show off.</li>
<li>Many people consider urban sprawl to be the fastest growing threat to their local environment and quality of life.</li>
<li>Excessive use of natural resources can place human life and animals at risk.</li>
<li>Many people regard cruelty to animals as a major moral issue.</li>

<li>Animals are widely used in experiments because their behaviour resembles considerably colsely that of humans.</li>
<li>Just as almost every human activity has costs as well as benefits, there are some drawbacks in expanding the global tourism industry.</li>
<li>Just as mechinery is integral to industrialization, the rapid transfer of information is central to the development of a service economy.</li>
<li>The conservation of indigenous cultures may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species is to life.</li>
<li>Since the automobile has made transportation to and from urban centres easy and inexpensive, urban living has lost the advantage of convenience.</li>
<li>As forest and other habitats are converted to residential, commercial or agricultural use, wild plants and animals vanish.</li>
<li>Since computers and the Internet became the mainstream in the early 1990s, its importance and centrality in communication has become unassilable/unalterable.</li>
<li>The role of architecture is unique because it combines art form with functional use.</li>
<li>Trees are very important because they can reduce pollutants and improve air quality.</li>
<li>English will cease to be a foreign language for many of the world’s citizens as it has been repositioned as a basic skill, and learned as a basic requirement for employability, alongside other 21th century skills, such as computer skills and numeracy.</li>
<li>The government should seek to meet social objectives while modernising the economy.</li>
<li>Although there is some upper limit to the intellectual ability of children of various ages, their potential will not be known with certainty.</li>
<li>While pollution on the world scale is still worsening, there is a clear trend toward decrease in the developed countries.</li>
<li>As economy and technolgy advance, more money and better techniques have become available for minimising pollution.</li>
<li>Regardless of / Irrespective of age or gender, people should have the equal access to job opportunities, provided that they are competent enough.</li>
<li>A prevailing notion is that oral messages are more important than non-verbal messages in communication.</li>
<li>Another fact to highlight the importance of teamwork is that on some complex assessments, students’ individual efforts are far from enough.</li>
<li>The net result of excessive energy use is that environmental problems are exacerbated, such as acid rain, the greenhouse effect, soil erosion and the general degradation of the quality of air, water and land.</li>
<li>The strongest argument against fashion is that it looks pretty and catches your eye but it is impractical indeed.</li>
<li>It is why stunning-looking buildings are far less marketable than those buildings with functional utility.</li>
<li>Another benefit of studying aboard is that we can meet the locals and sample the local culture.</li>
<li>We have recognised the fact that the emerging technologies are blurring the boundary between work and life.</li>
<li>It is universally belived that building conversation is of great importance, not only for the building’s inherent historical and aesthetic value but also as a reference for further architectural development.</li>
<li>It is likely that population pressure will lead to greater numbers of people living in the suburbs.</li>
<li>It is generally believed that culture can be deemed as the way of life for a society, including manners, dresses, languages, religions, rituals,</li>
<li>norms of behaviour and systems of belief.</li>
<li>It cannot be denied that most of the problems affecting the natural world such as ozone depletion, deforestations, species extinction and the greenhouse effect are by-products of ecominic growth.</li>
<li>There is little evidence that technological change have resulted in an overall education in employment.</li>
<li>Research has received that young people who are exposed to adversements for alcohol are likely to drink more.</li>
<li>Higher exposure to violence increases the chances that those exposed to the media will learn or contemplate using violence.</li>
<li>In architecture, functinalism represents a principle that architects should design a building based on the purpose of that building.</li>
